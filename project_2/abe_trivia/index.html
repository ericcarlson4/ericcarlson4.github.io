        <p>Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12,  1809 in a log cabin in Kentucky. As a young boy he loved to read, even though his parents were illiterate.  Sadly, though, his mother died when Abraham was still young, and his family moved to Indiana and later Illinois.  <br /><br />

Abe was very tall, 6’4” to be exact! He is still the tallest president to ever live in the White House.  He was also quite strong, and loved to box as a young man.  He also often wore a tall stovepipe hat, making him seem even taller!<br /><br />

Abe hated slavery.  Before he was president, he was made famous for a debate he had with Stephen Douglas about slavery. Not everyone agreed with Abe, though. The states in the South and even a few in the North had slaves, and not many people wanted that to change.  When Abe became president, the southern states were so mad, they left the United States and formed the Confederate States of America!  This began the Civil War, the bloodiest war in American history. Abe had to work hard to reuinite the country. At first, he just wanted unity, and didn’t try to free any of the slaves, but later, he saw it as important.  He wrote the emancipation proclamation which claimed to free all of the slaves in the south.  While it didn’t actually free any slaves, it inspired a lot of slaves to escape.  Slavery wasn’t actually abolished until the 13th amendment after the war, though.<br /><br />

Soon after the war ended and the country was united again, Abe was tragically shot by John Wilkes Booth in a theater in Washington, D.C.  He died later that night. Americans will always remember him for his bravery and ability to make hard decisions.
