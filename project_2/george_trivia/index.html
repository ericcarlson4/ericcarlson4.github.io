        <p>George Washington was born on February 22, 1732 in Virginia.  He was homeschooled as a child, but was very bright.  There’s a legend that George chopped down his father’s Cherry Tree when he was a teenager, but later confessed to having done the crime.  This showed that George was very honest, even though he made a mistake. <br /> <br /> 

As a young man, George fought in the French and Indian war, which the American colonies helped the British win.  George became famous in this war, and was made the commander of the Virginia troops, even though he was only 23! <br /> <br /> 

Some time after the war, he married a widow named Martha, who already had a few children. Washington loved the kids and raised them as his own.  He lived with Martha at his home, called Mount Vernon.<br /> <br /> 

When the American Revolution came around, Washington was made the commander of the Continental Army, making him one of the most important men of the revolution.  He was a bold general.  One time, he even planned a surprise attack on the enemy on Christmas Eve!  Washington crossed the Delaware with his troops and had an important victory.<br /> <br /> 

After the United States won their independence, Washington continued to be a leader.  He led the group of men who wrote the constitution, and eventually was elected the first president of the United States!  Many people weren’t sure what the president should be at that time, and there was no limit to how long you could be president. Washington decided that he didn’t want to be like a king, however, and left the presidency after 2 terms, only 8 years. Today, we remember him as the Father of our Country.
