        <p> Teddy Roosevelt was born October 27, 1858, in New York.  As a young boy he had asthma and couldn’t do a lot of the sports the other kids could. This made Teddy work even harder, though, started weight lifting and boxing as a teenager! He became a very strong and active man, and loved the outdoors.  <br /> <br />
Teddy did a lot before he became president. He was the governor of New York, became a rancher, fought in the Spanish-American war, and even wrote multiple books! He was the vice president of the United States when the president, William McKinley, was shot and killed. This made Teddy the President at the young age of 42—making him the youngest president of all time! <br /> <br />
Teddy’s love for the outdoors led him to push for the National Parks System, which protected precious and beautiful parts of our country like Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon. That way, no one would be able to build over them and ruin them!  Teddy did all of this and more as president, but still found time to read a book every day! <br /> <br />
After he left the presidency, his vice president, William Taft, became the next president. Teddy was pleased at first, but later he felt Taft was doing a bad job so he ran for president again! He made the Progressive Party: nicknamed the “Bull Moose Party,” and even though he didn’t win the election, he got a lot of votes. Once during his campaign, he was about to give a speech when a man shot him! Teddy was okay, though, and decided to give the speech anyways. “It takes a lot more than a bullet to take down a Bull Moose” he said.
